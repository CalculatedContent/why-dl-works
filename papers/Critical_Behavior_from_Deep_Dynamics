Critical Behavior from Deep Dynamics: A Hidden Dimension in Natural Language

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06737v2.pdf


This may be of immediate interest--it addresses exactly why Markov Chains can not treat critical / glassy phenomena
and that deep nets are necessary

In particular, it address the issue we discussed that we need slower than exponential decay
